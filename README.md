# 🫀 CardioPredict AI — Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Platform

A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts cardiovascular disease risk based on clinical health parameters using Random Forest machine learning, delivering instant clinical analysis, metric calculations, and personalized health recommendations.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Machine Learning Powered**: Uses a trained Random Forest model to compute personalized cardiovascular risk probability.
- **Clinical Biomarkers Analysis**: Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Pulse Pressure, and Blood Pressure Staging according to AHA guidelines.
- **Instant Risk Assessment**: Categorizes patients into Low Risk or High Risk with visual urgency indicators.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates tailored clinical guidance based on individual risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, etc.).
- **Modern Responsive UI**: Built with React, Vite, Lucide Icons, and Glassmorphism styling.
- **Fast & Lightweight Backend**: Built with Python FastAPI, Uvicorn, and compressed Joblib model serialization.
